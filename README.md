# **Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins: A Comprehensive Guide**  

## **Introduction**  
In modern DevOps and cloud-native development, **Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins** are essential tools that help automate deployments, manage containerized applications, and orchestrate workloads efficiently. This document provides an overview of these technologies, how they work, and how to set up Docker for seamless GitHub integration.

## **1. Docker: Containerization Platform**  

### **What is Docker?**  
Docker is an **open-source platform** that allows developers to **build, ship, and run** applications inside lightweight, portable **containers**. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.  

### **Key Features of Docker:**  
- **Lightweight:** Uses OS-level virtualization, unlike traditional virtual machines.  
- **Portable:** Works across any system supporting Docker.  
- **Fast Deployment:** Rapidly spin up and tear down applications.  
- **Isolation:** Each container runs independently with its own resources.  

### **Docker Architecture:**  
- **Docker Client:** CLI tool that interacts with the Docker daemon.  
- **Docker Daemon:** Runs in the background, managing containers.  
- **Docker Hub:** Cloud repository for storing and sharing container images.  
- **Docker Images:** Read-only templates for creating containers.  
- **Docker Containers:** Running instances of Docker images.  

### **Installing Docker**  
#### **On Ubuntu**  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

#### **On Windows/Mac**
Download and install **Docker Desktop** from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

### **Basic Docker Commands**
```bash
docker pull <image_name>      # Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx  # Run a container in detached mode
docker ps                     # List running containers
docker stop <container_id>     # Stop a running container
docker rm <container_id>       # Remove a stopped container
docker images                  # List available images
```

## 2. Kubernetes: Container Orchestration

### **What is Kubernetes?**
Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration system** that **automates deployment, scaling, and management** of containerized applications. It ensures that containers run efficiently and remain resilient in production environments.

### **Key Features of Kubernetes**
- **Automated Scaling:** Scales applications based on traffic.
- **Self-Healing:** Replaces failed containers automatically.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic across multiple containers.
- **Rolling Updates & Rollbacks:** Updates applications with minimal downtime.

### **Kubernetes Architecture**
- **Master Node:** Controls cluster operations.
- **Worker Nodes:** Run containerized applications.
- **Pods:** The smallest unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
- **Services:** Expose applications inside or outside the cluster.
- **Deployments:** Manage scaling and updates of applications.

### **Installing Kubernetes (Minikube)**

#### **On Ubuntu**
```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
minikube start
```

#### **On Windows/Mac**
Download and install **Minikube** from [Kubernetes' official site](https://kubernetes.io/).

### **Basic Kubernetes Commands**
```bash
kubectl get nodes          # List Kubernetes nodes
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx  # Deploy an Nginx container
kubectl get pods           # List running pods
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port=80  # Expose a service
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3  # Scale deployment to 3 replicas
```

## 3. Jenkins: CI/CD Automation

### **What is Jenkins?**
Jenkins is an **open-source automation tool** used for **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)**. It automates **building, testing, and deploying** software.

### **Key Features of Jenkins**
- **Automates Builds:** Runs build scripts automatically.
- **Integration with Docker & Kubernetes:** Deploys apps inside containers.
- **Plugins:** Supports thousands of plugins for integration.
- **Pipeline as Code:** Defines CI/CD pipelines using `Jenkinsfile`.

### **Installing Jenkins using Docker**
```bash
docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jenkins jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

### **Accessing Jenkins**
Once Jenkins is running, open your browser and go to:
localhost:8080
